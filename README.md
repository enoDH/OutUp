# OutUp
__OutUp__ is an open source application. The idea of the project is to give a person the opportunity to create their own trainings and share them 
with other people, find a coach, or become a coach for someone.

## For developers
### The first steps
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) which includes [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- Install the Angular CLI globally:
```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

### The next step
 ``` 
 npm install 
 ```
 Set the package dependencies in the client folder
 ``` 
 cd client
 ```
 ``` 
 npm install 
 ```
After installing all the dependencies, you can start the project (__in the root folder__)
 ``` 
 npm run dev
 ```
__You can view all available startup commands in the package.json file__
